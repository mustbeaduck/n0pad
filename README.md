<p>there is a more fun solution to animate this crap btw </p>

<p>since text in the edit window is stored consequently and newlines are rendered only after certain user actions - there is a more perfomant way to move picture around. basically u could just increment or decrement (buffer pointer)/(line count field)/(length field) to drag image around. i may or may not implemented this method and it may or may not crash after u exit the application</p>
